# Welcome to Fluxtion
Welcome to Fluxtion, hope you enjoy reading and exploring, good luck:) 

Fluxtion builds event processing applications that handle infinite streams of data. Write simple clean java code and create realtime applications, all the complex heavy lifting is taken care of by Fluxtion. Applications are quick to build, test, deploy and debug.

Fluxtion concentrates on the processing logic handling event streans, independent of messaging system. This independence makes Fluxtion a good fit for:

-  **Embedding realtime processing** within an existing system
-  **Edge processing** executing on edge devices
-  **No middleware vendor lockin** works with any messaging provider
-  **Low latency** or high performance requirements
